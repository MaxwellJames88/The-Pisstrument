# The-Pisstrument
This is an instrument that you play with your pee.

I made this using scotch tape, tinfoil, and an arduino.
Add the Piss-trument.ino code to the arduino software and connect everything accordind to my schematics.

PLEASE NOTE: In the schematics, it looks like the wires leadind to the digital pins are connected after the diodes but that is just overlap.
Those wires are really connected after the switches and before the diodes.
